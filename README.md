# Nvjp-1
This repository contains 1000 AF2 models of both Nvjp-1 (an intrinsically disordered protein) and T7RdhA (a globular protein).

Our models indicate that the Nvjp-1 models derivate to each other (mean RMSD ~6.5 Angs.) and T7RdhA models mostly resemble each other (mean RMSD ~0.5 Angs).
However, the pLDDT scores of both proteins are largely consistent for all Nvjp-1 (381 amino acids, blue) models, or for T7RdhA (406 amino acids, red) models. The shaded areas are mean+/-sd (cyan for Nvjp-1 and pink for T7RdhA). Therefore, the pLDDT scores provided by AF2 may serve as a useful feature for protein structures and/or disorders.
